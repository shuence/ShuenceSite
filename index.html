        <h2> ‚ú®Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a programming enthusiast, I love exploring new new things daily and always learning new new stuff daily 
          Improving my technical skills. I have experience working with Web development frameworks like React js and Node js and have a bit but enough knowledge of cloud computing like google cloud and AWS.
          But I'm not strong in Data Structures and Algorithms but I'll master it soon in next few years.
          I also love writing about my feelings, Mine own thoughts and much more coding tutorials and cheetsheets.
          I also love watching Anime and Playing games like I'm a full gamer I love exploring and playing new new games. 
          I also have great knowledge of linux and also the hacking stuffs but currently I stop exploring the world of hacking as my loved one don't like it me doing that bit illegal stuffs.
          Well I'll continue exploring it if i got permission from her.

        <h2>The purpose of my life ‚ú®ü§ç</h2>
        <p>
          To dream the impossible dream,
          To fight the unbeatable foe,
          To bear the unbearable sorrow,
          To run where the brave dare not to go,
          To right the unforgivable wrong,
          To love the pure and chaste from afar,
          To reach the unreachable star,
          This is my quest to follow that star,
          No matter how hopeless, no matter how far,
          To see you happy as long as I can,
          To help you whenever I can ,
          To do whatever I can to make you smile,
          To be by ur side whenever you need,
          To be with you in your good and bad time,
          To see you growing, being independent,
          Yes you you are the one of the most important cause for my running breaths , and lastly
          To fight for the right without questions without pause,
          To be willing to march into the hell for heavenly cause ‚ú®‚ú®
